# icl - interactive command library

icl is a user-friendly, interactive cheat sheet for your UNIX terminal.

Have your favorite one-liners allways at your fingertips.

## installation

One line installation is provided for convenience, but I encourage you read the
installation scripts.

### Fish shell

```shellscript
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plainas/icl/master/install_fish.sh | /bin/sh
```

Reload your fish config or start a new shell.

Note:
Iy you are still using fish 2, yon need to define the keybinding to ''f_run_icl'' yourself.

```


### Bash

```shellscript
